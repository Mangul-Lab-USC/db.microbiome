# Analysis of multiple fungal sequence repositories highlights shortcomings in microbial databases

Currently, the study only looks at the composition of four fungal genomic reference databases: 
 * [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
 * [Ensembl](http://fungi.ensembl.org/info/website/ftp/index.html)
 * [FungiDB](https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/release-41/)
 * [JGI 1000 Fungal Genomes Project](https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/fungi/fungi.info.html)

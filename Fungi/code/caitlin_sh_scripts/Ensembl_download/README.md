All the code found in this file will run wget on all the fungal ensembl references. Suggested to create a bash file that runs every one of these files (so you only have to run get_all.sh instead of each of the files here individually). As of writing this text file, none of these scripts throws an error. This will put .gz files into whatever directory you run it in. Used to get the Fungal reference database from Ensembl.
